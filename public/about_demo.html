<h1 id="demo-application">Demo Application</h1>
<p>This demonstration application is located in the <code>demo_app</code>
subfolder of the Programmable Sever&#39;s directory and is described in
detail in the forthcoming ebooklet
<a href="http://amazon.com">&ldquo;A Python Programmable Web Server&rdquo;</a>.
Many of you can learn what you want to know by reading the code and
comments in lieu of buying the ebooklet.  Each of the three sub
applications tells you where to find its code.</p>
<p>The application needs to be installed in the <a href="https://github.com/J-Adrian-Zimmer/ProgrammableServer.git">Programmable
server</a>.
If you are reading this you may have already done the installation.
</p>
<p>You can return the server to its original state by running
<code>restore.py</code> from the server&#39;s directory.</p>
<p>The demos are </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>echo</strong> which bounces text to the server and back in JSON
form using AJAX technology.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>showRequestParameters</strong> which shows
the various views of a browser request which are available through the
Programmable Server.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>uploadPic</strong> which uses an HTML form to upload a
picture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can invoke them with <code>localhost\echo</code> etc.  Each one will tell
you where to find its source code.</p>
