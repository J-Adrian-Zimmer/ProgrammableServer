<p>The <a href="https://github.com/J-Adrian_Zimmer/">Programmable
Server</a> is Python-based and bare bones.  It is made to have apps plugged into it.  </p>
<p>Here is a list of what is possible without any customization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get this screen by entering the abbreviated url <code>localhost</code> in your browser.</li>
<li>Shut the server down by entering <code>localhost/shutdown</code> in your browser.</li>
<li>See a bird picture by entering <code>localhost/media/wetBird.JPG</code> in your browser.</li>
<li>Add other things to the <code>public</code> subdirectory so you can see them the way you&#39;ve seen the bird picture.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <I>first customization</I> might be to search for
<code>web_root</code> in the configuration file <code>config.py</code> and set it to a
different directory.  This directory will become the root of your
static file service.  The default value of <code>web_root</code> is <code>public</code> which the server sees as a keyword telling it to use the default <code>public</code> subdirectory.  When you replace <code>public</code> be sure to use a full path name.  This  path name can point to anyplace on your computer.</p>
<p>Note that the original configuration only allows access from
browsers on the same computer as the server.
(Hence the use of <code>localhost</code> in the above above urls rather than the
more normal domain name or possible IP number.)  A <I>second
customization</I>
might be to allow access for
any browser that can reach your server&#39;s computer.  Do this by
setting <code>localServe</code>
to <code>False</code>.  
</p><p>
If you have a local network with a
<code>255.255.255.0</code> mask and
one gateway you can restrict access to browsers on this network by
assigning the IP/4 number of the gateway to <code>localServe</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are unsure what that last sentence means or whether it
applies to you, don&#39;t try it!
Accept that your choices are &quot;browsers on the same computer&quot; and
&quot;any browser that can reach your server&#39;s computer&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, regardless of how you set <code>localServe</code> the
<code>shutdown</code> command will only work from a browser on the
same computer as the server.
</p>
<p>A <I>third (and recommended) customization</I> might be to install the 
<a href="https://github.com/J-Adrian-Zimmer/">demonstration app</a>
which is located in the <code>demo_app</code> subdirectory.
</p><p>
The demonstration app together with its code and comments will be enough for some of you to start building your own applications.  Others may want to buy 
the displayed ebooklet.  It is available in Kindle format from Amazon and in epub format from many other sources.</p>
