<h1 style="text-align:center">Programmable Server<br>Demo Application</h1>
<p>The Programmable Server works by executing a sequence of 
&ldquo;expander&rdquo; modules.  Each of these is a Python file that
chooses to respond to a particular browser request or not.  Once a
response has happened no more expander files are executed.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this you have probably already installed the
demonstration app.   If not, 
<p>
<blockquote>go to the <code>demo_app</code> subdirectory of
the Programmable Server's directory and run <code>install.py</code>
using Python 2.7.x.  Then restart the server.
You can return the server to its original state by running
<code>restore.py</code> from the server&#39;s directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This demo application is not intended to be useful.  Rather it was
designed to show the variety of things a programmer of an expander
can do.</p>
<p>
There are four expanders in the demonstration:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>about</strong> which shows this page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>echo</strong> which bounces text to the server and
back using AJAX technology and formatting the transfer data with
JSON.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>showRequestParameters</strong> which shows
the various views of a browser request.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>uploadPic</strong> which uses an HTML form to upload a
picture.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can invoke these demonstrations with <code>localhost\about</code> etc.  Each one will tell
you where to find its source code.  It is that source code and the
included comments which will show you how to make your own
applications.</p>
